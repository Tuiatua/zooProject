    <dt><h1>The Mangrove</h1></dt>
    <em><dd><blockquote href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove">"A mangrove is a shrub or tree that grows mainly in coastal saline or brackish water. Mangroves grow in an equatorial<br>
        climate, typically along coastlines and tidal rivers. They have special adaptations to take in extra oxygen and to<br>
        remove salt, which allow them to tolerate conditions that would kill most plants."</blockquote></dd></em>

<p>The mangroves have first originated in <q>Late Cretaceous to Paleocene epochs</q>, and were spread apart extensively due</p>
   <p> to the Plate motion, or the movement of techonomic plates. Further, the oldest found fossils of the Mangrove go as far as</p>
    <p>75 million years ago. But what are mangroves? The trees that make up these mangroves contain a "complex" salt filtration </p>
   <p> system as well as A root system that is useful to the mangrove trees, to help with the <q>saltwater immersion and wave action</q>.</p>
