<p>What are savannas? The Savannas is a place with hot, dry, and wet type aspects with a ton of trees scattered around</p>
    <p>the place. They first originated as tropical places when suddenly the rainfall had been stumped and had produced less</p>
<p> less rainfall.<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/savanna" target="_blank">(Source)</a> The savannas environment is hot and dry, but for a</p>
<p>few months of the year it becomes somewhat wet. The savannas also divided into 3 segments, wet, dry, thornbush, with the 3<p>
<p>segments dependent on the length of the dry season, typically 7-5 months. </p>

    Serengeti plains, north to Kenya. This annual trek to find food and water covers a distance of around 2,900 kilometers<br>
    (1,800 miles) and exposes them to a myriad of dangers. River crossings leave herds vulnerable to crocodiles, while the<br>
    size of the migration itself brings lions, hyenas, and wild dogs.</em></blockquote>
<p>They also communicate by using their different vocal calls, which are basically a hollar to inform their fellow herd of</p>
    <p>things such as predators. The diet of the Zebra mainly consists of any type of grass and leaves.</p>
