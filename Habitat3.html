    <dt><h1>The Tundra</h1></dt>
    <em><dd><q>Tundra is the coldest of all the biomes. Tundra comes from the Finnish word tunturi, meaning treeless plain.<br>
        It is noted for its frost-molded landscapes, extremely low temperatures, little precipitation, poor nutrients, and short growing seasons.</q></dd></em>

<p>Tundras are, for the most part, covered in snow for most of the year. Only a small amount of wildlife choose to live there.</p>
<p>There are two types of Tundras, Arctic, which is very bare in trees due to the frosty environment and the short amount</p>
<p>of time that organic life has to grow, and Alpine, which are located on the mountainous areas and also lack the presence</p>
<p>of trees do to the high elevation</p>
<blockquote href="https://sciencing.com/tundra-characteristics-6817564.html"><em>The climate of the tundra is very similar to that of a desert in that it is very dry and windy and can experience extreme temperatures.</em></blockquote>

    thaws and heavy rains. They also prefer to establish burrows on sites with good visibility, which affords better predator detection. </em></blockquote>
<p>The Squirrels live in colonies of hundreds of squirrel, as well as A underground system of tunnels and burrows,</p>
<p>with a single mother raising a young squirrel.</p>

    <q><em>oeconomus arenicola.</em></q></p>
<p>The diet of the Tundra Voles consist of grass and seeds. They are also prone to make burrows for food for the winter such as</p>
    <p>a squirrel hiding its nuts.</p>
