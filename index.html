    <dt><h1><a href="Habitat1.html">The Desert</a></h1></dt>
    <dd><em><q>A desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, living conditions<br>
        are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to denudation.</q></em></dd>
    <br>

    <dt><h1><a href="Habitat2.html">The Savanna</a></h1></dt>
    <dd><em><q>A savanna or savannah is a mixed woodland-grassland (i.e. grassy woodland) ecosystem characterised by the<br>
        trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the canopy does not close.</q></em></dd>
    <br>

    <dt><h1><a href="Habitat3.html">The Tundra</a></h1></dt>
    <dd><em><q>Tundra is the coldest of all the biomes. Tundra comes from the Finnish word tunturi, meaning treeless plain.<br>
        It is noted for its frost-molded landscapes, extremely low temperatures, little precipitation, poor nutrients, and short <br>
        growing seasons.</q></em></dd>
    <br>

    <dt><h1><a href="Habitat4.html">The Mangrove</a></h1></dt>
    <dd><em><blockquote href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove">"A mangrove is a shrub or tree that grows mainly in coastal saline or brackish water. Mangroves grow in an equatorial<br>
        climate, typically along coastlines and tidal rivers. They have special adaptations to take in extra oxygen and to<br>
        remove salt, which allow them to tolerate conditions that would kill most plants."</blockquote></em></dd>
    <br>

    <dt><h1><a href="Habitat5.html">The Woodland</a></h1></dt>
    <dd><em><blockquote href="https://australian.museum/learn/teachers/learning/woodland-habitats/#:~:text=Woodlands%20are%20places%20where%20the,of%20trees%2C%20rocks%20and%20bushes.">"Woodlands are places where the trees are spaced apart with heath and grassland in between. They often have open grassy<br>
        spaces as well as clumps of trees, rocks and bushes."</blockquote></em></dd>
