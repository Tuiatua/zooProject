    <dt><h1>The Desert</h1></dt>
    <em><dd><q>A desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, living conditions<br>
        are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to denudation.</q></dd></em>

<p>Deserts are wastelands of the earth, Which are formed due to the intense heat and weathering, at which point various other</p>
<p>erosion can take place when the rocks are burning hot. One thing you may know is deserts are one the driest places on the planet,</p>
<p>what you may not know is that it is due to the little amounts of rainfall or other processes involving water such as snow, yes snow.</p>
<blockquote href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert"><em>One of the driest places on Earth is the Atacama Desert. It is virtually devoid of life because it is blocked<br>
    from receiving precipitation by the Andes mountains to the east and the Chilean Coast Range to the west.</em></blockquote>
<p>Another aspect of the desert is its wildlife. Two examples of desert animals are listed bellow</p>
<br>

<p>Whenever you think of the desert, the camel is most likely the first thing that comes into your mind. Although disputed between people,</p>
    <em><blockquote href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-camels.htm#:~:text=The%20Camel%20family%20(Camelidae)%20first,to%203%20million%20years%20ago.">The Camel family (Camelidae) first evolved in North America approximately 44 million years ago during the Eocene<br>
        period. Camelops first appeared in the fossil record during the Late Pliocene of North America between 4 to 3 million years ago.</blockquote></em>
<p>Camels are animals that have a hump on their back, and are mainly used for transportation across the desert.</p>

   <p> south america. they are also small animals with a little bit of weight on them.</p>
